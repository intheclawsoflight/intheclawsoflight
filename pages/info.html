                    <p>Andrew Haire</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Born 1999 in Fort Walton Beach, FL</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My work explores the intersections of technology, non-human systems, and contemporary life through video, photography, and multimedia practices. By remixing digital objects—images, video, sound, and text sourced from the Internet—I investigate how modern existence is mediated by the technologies we use. Through this lens, my work reflects on algorithms, data, and digital infrastructures as active agents shaping our reality, often outside the boundaries of human perception or control.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The subject and form of my work are intrinsically connected. Digital media's inherent qualities, such as time, pixelation, and fragmentation, are mirrored in my aesthetic choices, emphasizing the agency of the technologies that generate and sustain these forms. I aim to decentralize human narratives, shifting the focus toward the hidden mechanisms of non-human systems. I examine how continuously composing and recomposing global content in the digital realm mediates today's universal experiences, exploring the processes of these data streams as autonomous and self-generating.</p>

                    <p>Today's universal experiences, exploring the processes of these data streams as autonomous and self-generating. Furthermore, my work seeks to reject traditional distinctions that tie media to representation or human-centric purpose. Instead, my work reflects on technological and algorithmic systems that operate independently of human intention, presenting digital media as more than tools—entities with their own internal logic and dynamics. I extend this framework to data-driven systems, such as the infrastructure of media platforms, considering how they function and technologies designed to collect data as simultaneous creators and containers of reality.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I am curious about how these technologies transform how we think, feel, and relate. The boundless leaping through media platforms, the aesthetic distortions of compressed data, and the anonymized logic of algorithms reflect emergent networked worlds beyond recognition. My work invites viewers to confront the dissonance between their mediated experiences and the autonomous systems shaping them. By embracing these vertiginous and often hazy interactions with digital media, I seek to provoke questions about our complicity and position within this rapidly evolving cultural landscape. Ultimately, my work is not about controlling or demystifying technology but creating spaces to reckon with its autonomy and ambiguity, suggesting a world continually constructed beyond human intent.</p>
